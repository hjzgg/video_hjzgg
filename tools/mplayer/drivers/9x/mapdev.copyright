I posted an answer to your question in the newsgroup. I also have
additional information for you.

I can email you the binary for VxD which does exactly what you need:
given a physical address, returns a pointer that can be used by a
Win32 application. I'll also give you source for a Win32 app which
uses the VxD to read an area of physical memory.

I don't offer this solution to everyone, since in most cases the
proper solution is for them to write a VxD which interacts with their
hardware, rather than simply getting a pointer to the hardware and
interacting with it from an application.

However, in your case, you're just using a VxD as a tool to get your
Linux driver working...you shouldn't have to write a VxD for this :-)

Let me know if you're interested.

Hello Karen

A long time ago, you sent me your VXD for reading an area of physical
memory under Win32, so I could make register dumps of the graphic
chip. Did I ever mention, that it works perfectly for me?

Why I contact you is, that I really would like to offer this solution
to all XFree86 members, so that it will be much easier in the future
for XFree86 to develop drivers for graphic boards.

Can I count with your agreement? Would you like to add a special
copyright to your software?

Stefan

OK, you have my permission to make it publicly available, as is. 

If you make it available on the web (ftp, etc.), please give me the
URL so I can refer others to it.
